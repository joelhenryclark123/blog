Last Friday of 2020! It's Christmas, so I feel a little bad about writing a blog post, but I'll keep it short.

# Beaver
Last week, I was worried about not knowing what to do. I realized that if I'm willing to give up Beaver, I'm also willing to experiment and fail. So, I finally decided to start building the app's school support. I'm going to start with a sloppy Canvas integration (Canvas is my school's learning management system). I discovered they have a GraphQL server that I can use to query information.

So far, I've made a small side-application to demo the ability to call the Canvas API, and I've started design on the in-app integration on Figma. I feel like I'm on the right route.

# Books
I went on a spree and bought way too many of books over the past few days. I realized that I felt overwhelmed, and I need to narrow it down to three non-fiction and one fiction (for entertainment) at a time. I decided on *The Design of Everyday Things*, *EMPOWERED*, and *The Obstacle is The Way*. For my fiction book, I'm enjoying *American Gods*.

# NextRound
I finished up most of my work with NextRound. Tomorrow, I'll work on tying up remaining loose ends, and then it's time to submit to the app store.

# Next Week
* Get out of the Christmas laziness
* Finish *The Design of Everyday Things*
* Start programming the Canvas prototype into Beaver
