I can't believe this week's already over! I've been studying for PM interviews, mostly. I've also prototyped a new feature for Beaver, and studied some cool stuff!

# Beaver
This has been a productive week for Beaver. I realized that I had a bit of a lack of alignment and hadn't thought through much strategy (maybe a SWOT analysis would help), so I've ventured to find some information that'd help me get un-stuck. I've opened the book sprint, and I thought the intro was great. I'm not moving as fast as I'd like, so I'm looking for ways to get going.

## Goals
I think part of the key to me figuring out Beaver is setting goals. I set a goal of $200/year revenue, but I then realized that this isn't a revenue product. So, I decided to seek rpoduct-market fit. My question was... what does this even look like? As an analogy, I said dog leashes and dog owners. That's perfect product-market fit. So, Beaver's target market is working people. Now, it's time to cross the chasm.

## Market research
I made a post on Reddit describing the index card system, and it got more attention than I originally expected. Once I started responding to comments, other people started commenting, and I went from 4 to 9 comments with 8 upvotes. That feels like a real spark of interest. I'm also proud of myself for writing a good headline.

# Books
I started reading sprint, but I'm realizing that it's more of a specialized guide. I don't need to read it right now, but I know where to find it if I ever do. It seems like a cool way to quickly tackle tough challenges.

# Next Week
I want to finish INSPIRED, and maybe implement a new feature for Beaver. I have a lot adding up!
