I like to build things, but as of today, 10/17/20, I feel out of control. My mind’s all over the place. I need something clear, and some kind of publishing outlet, so here I am. I’m going to start writing.


## What’s the point?
I’m writing to my future self. I want to be able to reflect on my thought process building things. So, I’m journaling on this blog. Maybe other people will enjoy it, too, but it’s for me.


## Who Am I?
Today, I’m lost. I can code and design, and I want to consistently publish successful products. I need a break, and I’m hoping this blog will help me find it.


## Vision
I’m going to reflect on my product building journey on this blog on Fridays for the rest of 2020. I don’t have the structure down, but that’s the commitment.
