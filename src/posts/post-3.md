Well, it's been a full week. I can't say it was my most productive week in terms of projects. I've had to focus on schoolwork and take care of some personal business this week.

## Blog
On Monday, I finally got this blog published to GitHub Pages. I still need to edit text styles, but it's working and pretty easy to get new posts up. I finally got the footer navigation to work, too.

## Beaver
I made some good progress with the QR system today. I uploaded a prototype [QR Code Generator](http://104.248.54.113/cps276/qr-test/index.php) to my server. I've added an inboxDate property to Beaver's ToDos so users can plan ahead without being bombarded with unfinished tasks on the pink screen.

I'm building this feature for students, for now. I think it'd be a huge help to scan a QR code and have all of your deadlines, assignments, etc uploaded to your phone. It's still in prorotype, but I'll work on demoing it with some users this week.

## Next Week's Goals
- • Design Blog typography
- • Finish [Nudge](https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X)
- • Make conceptual progress on Beaver QR

## Conclusion
That's it for this week! I feel on top of things. Like I said earlier, I had to clear some personal responsibilities from my plate, and now I'm good to keep building projects!
