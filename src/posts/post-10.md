I'm back at home in Omaha, and I forgot to do a post last Friday, so I'm doing one today. Over the past week, I've read a lot, and picked up a new project for NextRound. I'm also realizing that I need to change it up with Beaver.

# Beaver
I'm stressed and think I need a co-founder. At least, I need user interviews. I was thinking about giving up, and then I realized that if I'm willing to give up, now is a great time to try out new stuff -- after all, it's okay if it fails. Shout out to Ryan Holiday.

Unfortunately, I don't know if it's an appropriate time to talk to people about being a co-founder. What'll I do? Text? Although, it's a good time because we're in a school break, so there's time to onboard. I guess I'd have to figure out what onboarding is in this case.

Anyway, development's halted for now, and I'm just reading and working for NextRound. I'm still a Beaver user, which is a nice perspective to take on, for now.

# NextRound
I picked up a project to help NextRound launch their newest version. It's been a lot of work, but it feels good to have something to do over the extended break. It's kind of stressful, but it's not a 24/7 affair, which is cool. Plus, I'm getting to try out all kinds of new skills, and can look at it in the context of preparation for work.

# Books
I'm reading Ryan Holiday's *The Obstacle is The Way*, which is awesome. It's firing me up and making me feel like I can accomplish anything. I'm also reading Growth Hacker Marketing, which is enlightening, to say the least.

Last week, I finished *Hooked*, which had a great ending. I enjoyed the investment part, and the benevolence analysis framework. I think with Beaver, it helps people and I use it, which is a great intersection.

Last night, I finished *Slaughterhouse-five*, the first fiction novel I've read cover-to-cover in over 7 years. It rocked! Next up on the fiction docket, Neil Gaiman's *American Gods*. I'm excited to get lost in a long novel.

# Next (this?) week
- Finish up major parts of NextRound project
- Do something creative
