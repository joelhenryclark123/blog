A couple things came up that I hadn't anticipated, and it got in the way of work. As far as project progress goes, I really only improved Beaver by writing a spec for a modal that appears after scanning a QR Code. I haven't even begun design or code on it!</p>\n<p>I realized that I never fixed the typography for this blog. That's okay. It's mostly designed for me to publish, and I'm not too concerned about readability. There's no traffic or anything to this blog.</p>\n<h2>Nudge</h2>\n<p>I finished Nudge this week!

Now, it's time to put the learning into practice.</p>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Feedback matters in choice architecture</li>\n<li>Choice architects can provide a lot of benefit by mapping choices to outputs in an understandable fashion</li>\n<li>Choice architecture is often unavoidable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've noticed all kinds of choice architecture in the real world since I began Nudge.
