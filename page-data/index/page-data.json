It's Christmas, so I feel a little bad about writing a blog post, but I'll keep it short.</p>\n<h2>Beaver</h2>\n<p>Last week, I was worried about not knowing what to do. I realized that if I'm willing to give up Beaver, I'm also willing to experiment and fail. So, I finally decided to start building the app's school support. I'm going to start with a sloppy Canvas integration (Canvas is my school's learning management system). I discovered they have a GraphQL server that I can use to query information.</p>\n<p>So far, I've made a small side-application to demo the ability to call the Canvas API, and I've started design on the in-app integration on Figma. I feel like I'm on the right route.</p>\n<h2>Books</h2>\n<p>I went on a spree and bought way too many of books over the past few days. I realized that I felt overwhelmed, and I need to narrow it down to three non-fiction and one fiction (for entertainment) at a time. I decided on <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, <em>EMPOWERED</em>, and <em>The Obstacle is The Way</em>. For my fiction book, I'm enjoying <em>American Gods</em>.</p>\n<h2>NextRound</h2>\n<p>I finished up most of my work with NextRound. Tomorrow, I'll work on tying up remaining loose ends, and then it's time to submit to the app store.</p>\n<h2>Next Week</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Get out of the Christmas laziness</li>\n<li>Finish <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></li>\n<li>Start programming the Canvas prototype into Beaver</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 25, 2020","title":"Week 11"}}},"pageContext":{"date":"2020-12-25","slug":"/2020-12-25","currentPage":"1","lastPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
