I can't say it was my most productive week in terms of projects. I've had to focus on schoolwork and take care of some personal business this week.</p>\n<h2>Blog</h2>\n<p>On Monday, I finally got this blog published to GitHub Pages. I still need to edit text styles, but it's working and pretty easy to get new posts up. I finally got the footer navigation to work, too.</p>\n<h2>Beaver</h2>\n<p>I made some good progress with the QR system today. I uploaded a prototype <a href=\"http://104.248.54.113/cps276/qr-test/index.php\">QR Code Generator</a> to my server. I've added an inboxDate property to Beaver's ToDos so users can plan ahead without being bombarded with unfinished tasks on the pink screen.</p>\n<p>I'm building this feature for students, for now. I think it'd be a huge help to scan a QR code and have all of your deadlines, assignments, etc uploaded to your phone. It's still in prototype, but I'll work on demoing it with some users this week.</p>\n<h2>Next Week's Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>• Design Blog typography</li>\n<li>• Finish <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X\">Nudge</a></li>\n<li>• Make conceptual progress on Beaver QR</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>That's it for this week! I feel on top of things. Like I said earlier, I had to clear some personal responsibilities from my plate, and now I'm good to keep building projects!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 30, 2020","title":"Week 3"}}},"pageContext":{"date":"2020-10-30","slug":"/2020-10-30","currentPage":"1","lastPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
