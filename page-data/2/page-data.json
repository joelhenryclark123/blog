I reiterated on the navigation, and it feels great. Once I did this, I expected development to start feeling easy and to instantly develop production-level stuff. Nope! Now, I don't know what to do. I'm frustrated with Beaver, so I'm going to take the weekend off.</p>\n<h2>Beaver</h2>\n<p>Like I said, I made some good progress with Beaver. Last week, I published a new footer. After showing it to some people, I felt good enough about it to iterate, making it look even better. I also finally got around to adding the focus mode animation I'd been hoping for!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, like I said in the intro, I feel stuck now with Beaver. I don't know what to do now. Maybe I need to validate the higher-fidelity footer design, but I'm pretty confident it's an improvement, so why bother! After reading crossing the chasm more, I've decided to set target on a new group of customers, with a headpin strategy into the next. That feels good.</p>\n<h2>Books</h2>\n<p>I finished three books yesterday! I'm proud of myself. One of the books was Ryan Holiday's <em>Growth Hacker Marketing</em>, which got me woke on the fact that a good product, and product-market fit are the keys to marketing. Now, I feel all this pressure to improve my product for the target market, which is probably a good thing! Next up, I'm going to try and figure out how students would use Beaver for schoolwork, and do a discovery sprint on the matter.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Beaver Discovery Sprint for students</li>\n<li>Keep reading</li>\n<li>Work on creative writing!</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 11, 2020","title":"Week 9"}}},"pageContext":{"date":"2020-12-11","slug":"/2020-12-11","currentPage":"2","lastPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
