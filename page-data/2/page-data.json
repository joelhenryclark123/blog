Over the past week, I've read a lot, and picked up a new project for NextRound. I'm also realizing that I need to change it up with Beaver.</p>\n<h2>Beaver</h2>\n<p>I'm stressed and think I need a co-founder. At least, I need user interviews. I was thinking about giving up, and then I realized that if I'm willing to give up, now is a great time to try out new stuff -- after all, it's okay if it fails. Shout out to Ryan Holiday.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I don't know if it's an appropriate time to talk to people about being a co-founder. What'll I do? Text? Although, it's a good time because we're in a school break, so there's time to onboard. I guess I'd have to figure out what onboarding is in this case.</p>\n<p>Anyway, development's halted for now, and I'm just reading and working for NextRound. I'm still a Beaver user, which is a nice perspective to take on, for now.</p>\n<h2>NextRound</h2>\n<p>I picked up a project to help NextRound launch their newest version. It's been a lot of work, but it feels good to have something to do over the extended break. It's kind of stressful, but it's not a 24/7 affair, which is cool. Plus, I'm getting to try out all kinds of new skills, and can look at it in the context of preparation for work.</p>\n<h2>Books</h2>\n<p>I'm reading Ryan Holiday's <em>The Obstacle is The Way</em>, which is awesome. It's firing me up and making me feel like I can accomplish anything. I'm also reading <em>Hacking Growth</em>, which is enlightening, to say the least.</p>\n<p>Last week, I finished <em>Hooked</em>, which had a great ending. I enjoyed the investment part, and the benevolence analysis framework. Beaver helps people, and I use it, which is a great intersection.</p>\n<p>Last night, I finished <em>Slaughterhouse-five</em>, the first fiction novel I've read cover-to-cover in over 7 years. It rocked! Next up on the fiction docket, Neil Gaiman's <em>American Gods</em>. I'm excited to get lost in a long novel.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Finish up major parts of NextRound project</li>\n<li>Do something creative</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 21, 2020","title":"Week 10"}}},"pageContext":{"date":"2020-12-21","slug":"/2020-12-21","currentPage":"2","lastPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
