I'm pumped to write this out because I've finally moved my blog to a site that I built myself! I'm using React and Gatsby, and planning to serve it through GitHub Pages. I'll get it uploaded later.</p>\n<h2>Projects</h2>\n<p>Since this is my first Friday blog, it's time to start experimenting with post format. For now, I'll just write out my progress on each of my projects.</p>\n<h3>Blog</h3>\n<p>Last Friday, guilted by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KH1J644/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&#x26;btkr=1\">This Book</a>, I decided to start writing more. Now, I'm writing every Friday to reflect on my week. At least for the rest of 2020.</p>\n<p>I posted on Medium, but decided to try and build my own blog. I went ahead and designed it in <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/cHqA0jDYTdE1rhBHyvPmI3/Blog?node-id=0%3A1\">Figma</a>, and started building it with ReactJS. As of today, it's really barebones. It's essentially in Beta! I still need to edit text, and add the post-navigation-thingy from the designs.</p>\n<h3>Beaver</h3>\n<p>Last week, I read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742\">The Mom Test</a>, which sparked a push to build customer conversation skills. One quote really hit me: \"Before building for everyone, you must build for <em>someone</em>\". I'd started noticing that Beaver needs some kind of specialization. It's spread too thin, right now.</p>\n<p>I talked to some friends about their troubles managing school and life, and most of them weren't too stressed. However, I discovered that it's really stressful for people to manage having several assignments at once. So, I prototyped out a new feature for the Beaver App.</p>\n<p>I built a QR Code Scanner into the app. It allows users to import a list of tasks right into the app -- like schoolwork. I prototyped a <a href=\"http://104.248.54.113/cps276/qr-test/index.php\">QR code generator</a> and used it for one of my classes.</p>\n<p>I discovered it feels pretty awesome to have your whole schedule uploaded to your to do list so quickly. (Un?)fortunately, I'm already anticipating problems -- what if an assignment changes, for example? This may require building a website for people to generate codes and manage the assignments.</p>\n<p>I also feel that I need to add a module to confirm added assignments. I have a lot to think about! I'm just glad that I built this feature and have time to figure it out. I like the challenge a lot.</p>\n<h3>NextRound</h3>\n<p>I finally finished up work for NextRound! Now, I'll have more time to focus on projects, like this blog! I'm grateful for the experience I had with NextRound. I learned a lot.</p>\n<p>I'm glad for the team I worked with, and glad that everyone's getting great experience with entreureneurship and product development.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I had a really productive week. Next week, I'm planning to publish this blog, think strategy for Beaver QR, and maybe build a new side project</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 23, 2020","title":"Blog's up"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-10-17","currentPage":"2","lastPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
