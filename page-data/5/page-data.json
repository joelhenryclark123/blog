In fact, I just submitted a new build for Beaver to The App Store, today!</p>\n<h2>Beaver</h2>\n<p>I decided to tackle usability problems this week. I designed a new footer for beaver, and removed the add bar. For now, it's replaced by an add button that shows an alert with a UITextField when tapped. Eventually, I want to change this experience to be more robust, but it works just fine for now.</p>\n<p>The footer has back and forward buttons, with a nudge on the forward button when you're ready. I'm proud of my design for it, and it's really easy to manage thanks to Figma's varients!</p>\n<p>I also added some new headers in replacement of the old add bar. These headers give me a real understanding of the stage I'm at in the app, which is great.</p>\n<p>Next week, I want to test it with users. I want to conduct at least 5 usability tests, and have > 90% of them reporting a clear understanding of the app's workflow, without my input.</p>\n<h3>Next steps</h3>\n<p>Once usability is working, I'm going to do an assessment on business needs. I think I'll start honing in on the student market. I just need general usability to come back positive.</p>\n<h2>Books</h2>\n<p>I'm still cranking through INSPIRED. I think I'll be done this week, as I'm through the core of it and getting into the ideas. I've spent a lot of time taking notes on the core parts, but now I can just read. It's been a real eye-opener. I love the missionary vs mercenary ideas.</p>\n<p>Design of everyday things is an awesome book, still. I'm through two chapters, as I've tried to focus my energy on INSPIRED. Hopefully, I'll finish it up this week. I'm interested in the stages of action, and emotional design.</p>\n<h2>Next Week</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare for interviews</li>\n<li>Finish up assignments for the semester</li>\n<li>Usability tests</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 27, 2020","title":"Week 7"}}},"pageContext":{"date":"2020-11-27","slug":"/2020-11-27","currentPage":"5","lastPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
