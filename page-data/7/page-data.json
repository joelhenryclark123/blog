I interviewed for a job, but it wasn't what I thought it'd be. I didn't get the job, which is totally understandable considering it didn't feel like a match to me. It was focused on product management for internal tools, and I think that I really shine as a customer-facing product manager focused on innovation. That just wasn't this job, at all.</p>\n<h2>Beaver</h2>\n<p>I made a lot of progress with Beaver. After reading Inspired and Hooked, I learned a lot about our user experience problems. I realized that the app's a little confusing, but it's not nearly as far away from being usable as I thought. There are just some glaring issues with the conversion funnel. However, they're now that they're glaring.</p>\n<h3>Usability Problems</h3>\n<p>I discovered that on first launch, people want to explore the entire system. They go ahead and enter something they have to do, then press complete day. Unfortunately, they're stuck on that screen. This has taught me that the first-day experience is something that needs careful attention. It's not like the other days.</p>\n<p>On the first day, you need to enter all of your tasks, and select the things to do if you have anything else. This can be walked through if I'm standing directly behind someone, but it's tough for someone on the first try. Especially in usabillity interviews.</p>\n<p>How will I solve this? I think I need to test methods. The first one I want to try is telling someone to spend 60 seconds adding everything that comes to mind, like a brainstorming session. I think this would lead to people getting a lot more down that they need to do. Right now, people only enter the things they're going to do today, and stop adding more to the app.</p>\n<h3>Add Bar Confusion</h3>\n<p>I also noticed that people don't toally understand where their tasks are going on the add bar. It doesn't make a ton of sense on first glance. Today, I designed a feature that let's you choose whether a new item goes to the pink screen or blue screen. Pink screen's the default, so it doesn't take any action, but having the option there, with Pink selected, makes it so much clearer where your task disappeared to.</p>\n<p>I don't think this even needs validation because it's so clearly useful. I think I'll keep showing the app to new people and see if people seem to understand the add bar better than previous new users.</p>\n<h3>Done Screen Requests</h3>\n<p>I've noticed that a lot of people are asaking for the ability to plan tomorrow on the done screen, or see everything on the list. I suppose this is a need to feel in control of tomorrow. This is the lowest item on the roadmap, for now. I want to make sure it's still necessary after implementing the new add bar functionality.</p>\n<h2>Blog</h2>\n<p>Last week, I decided to make this blog private. After all, it's only intended for me right now. Making it public wouldn't reach any audiences because I'm not promoting it anywhere, yet. I still need to fix typography, but I don't see that happening until later. Right now, my main objective is compiling blog posts</p>\n<h2>Next Week</h2>\n<p>I hope to implement / validate this new add bar feature, and read. I also need to reflect on my interview and see what I can learn from it!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 13, 2020","title":"Week 5"}}},"pageContext":{"date":"2020-11-13","slug":"/2020-11-13","currentPage":"7","lastPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
