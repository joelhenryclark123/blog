I got a lot of reading in, made more progress with Beaver, and nearly wrapped up my semester of schoolwork!</p>\n<h2>Beaver</h2>\n<p>I created a new UI for Beaver -- I added a new footer. I sent it to a few people for review, and got some good feedback. There were navigation issues before -- the controls were confusing. So, I adopted an (more) easily usable interface, and the feedback I got this week didn't mention any navigation confusion!</p>\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\n<p>I'm realizing that there's still some confusion about the overall system. It's explained on the app store page, but I'm not even sure most people look at it. If it's a part of my funnel, I may want people to look at it when I'm doing interviews.</p>\n<p>One interviewee didn't understand the full system, and when I explained it, they lit up. They also told me that they like the ability to go back, and everyone I spoke to mentioned that they like the add button more than the add bar. That's progress!</p>\n<p>Another interviewee didn't seem to get the whole system, but pointed out the need for a well-fleshed-out adding interface, which I'm excited to get to at some point. This person also didn't like the current onboarding solution -- I don't either! Good thing I didn't spend too much time on it!</p>\n<h3>Progress this week</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I updated the left and right buttons on the blue screen. Now, you can end your day whenever you want, and you can easily go back and forth between the pink and blue screens.</li>\n<li>I took care of some technical debt by cleaning up the AppState file a bit. That really needed to be done!</li>\n<li>I'm designing a new onboarding module in Figma. I think it'd be pretty easy to implement!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Prototype new onboarding</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>School</h2>\n<p>I'm 99% done with my semester, which is really nice. I only have two online exams, two online homeworks, and ~30 minutes of work on a web dev project. Then, I'm free to work on my own stuff and prepare for readmission.</p>\n<p>Today, I talked to my academic advisor at Michigan, and I'm getting ready to reapply to U of M. It's been a great suspension, and I'm exited to make this reapplication official!</p>\n<h2>Job Recruiting</h2>\n<p>I'm expecting a PM Internship interview eventually. So, I've been practicing interview skills for a while. I've found a couple of stories I'd like to tell, and I'm soaking up information that could help me for interviews. Right now, I'm worried about my behavioral interview sounded too pre-meditated. The catch-22 is that I need recitation to practice!</p>\n<p>I'm learning the art of storytelling. I don't want to remember every single word. I just want to know they key points. I don't need exact words for these key points, either! I learned that before written language, people memorized thousand-plus line poems. They didn't go word for word, they just told the story, and developed as storytellers. I don't want to tell the same story the same way every time in interviews.</p>\n<h2>Books</h2>\n<p>I picked up several new books this week, most notably: <em>Crossing the Chasm</em>. I'm really enjoying this one. So far, I'm picking up on its framework in real life. I'm understanding the technology adoption lifecycle as a marketing framework, which is awesome. I'm also so relieved to learn the definition of market involving reference customers.</p>\n<p>In inspired, I read the customer discovery program section, which was just what I needed to develop an early growth strategy. I don't want to go into details in this blog, but I'm going to follow their framework -- getting 10+ reference users in a market that's several segments into my bigger target market. Having frameworks can be really empowering and encouraging.</p>\n<p>I'm also finishing up Ryan Holliday's <em>Trust Me I'm Lying</em>, which I've enjoyed so much so far. Now, I'm in the second half of the book -- the one that discusses the consequences of manipulating media. Holliday is awesome.</p>\n<h2>Next Week Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep Reading</li>\n<li>Talk to users (Beaver)</li>\n<li>Discover new features</li>\n<li>Finish all schoolwork (besides finals)</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 04, 2020","title":"Week 8"}}},"pageContext":{"date":"2020-12-04","slug":"/2020-12-04","currentPage":"3","lastPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
